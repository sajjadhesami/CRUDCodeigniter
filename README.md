# CRUDCodeigniter
This is a Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) PHP Codeigniter project. To run the application on your server, copy the files to your server and rename the `CRUDCodeigniter-main` folder to `CRUDCodeigniter`. Then, you should run the SQL codes in the `database.sql` file and configure the database credentials according to your database's credentials in `application/config/database.php`. 

There will be a user with the username and password of "Admin" (it is sensitive to capital letters in passwords). The system involves two types of users: 
1) administrator users are able to remove and edit the posts of other users as well as remove their accounts completely; 
2) normal users are only able to post and edit their own messages.
