# CRUDCodeigniter
A Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) PHP Codeigniter project. To run the application on your server, you should run the SQL codes in the database.sql file and configure the database credentials according to your database's credentials in application/config/database.php. There will be a user with the username and password of "Admin" (it is capital sensitive for passwords). The system involves two types of users: 1) administrator users are able to remove and edit the posts of other users as well as remove their accounts completely; 2) normal users are only able to post and edit their own messages.
